This is my first attempt to write something great (again :D)

I want to learn how does OS work and this is main reason why I've started this project.

# Getting started

#### Requirements

To compile and run this project, you will need:
* the NASM assembler
* the GNU linker
* GRUB bootloader
* a Linux x64 operating system

#### Running the code

Simply use the following commands in a terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/AnyKeyShik/SimpleKernel.git
cd SimpleKernel
make run
```

#### Runtime erros:
* 0 - Mulitboot error
* 1 - CPUID error
* 2 - Long Mode error
